While in school we were required to work on a verity projects in ether c or java. We found that doing a lot of small projects helped with learning a language and good programming practices but many of us where far to hesitant to learn a new language because we've become comfortable with c and java. To overcome this a few of us overachievers had the idea of continuing with the small projects but instead of just doing it in just one language we will use as many as we can. And so this website was born.
</p>
<p>
To accomplish our idea, each project will follow these simple goals:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open source and well documented</li>
	<li>Focus on the most popular languages: Java, Javascript, Python, Golang, C++, and C#</li>
	<li>Use visuals as much as posable</li>
	<li>Interesting and fun</li>
</ul>
