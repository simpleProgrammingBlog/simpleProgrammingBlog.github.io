While in school we were required to work on a verity projects in ether c or java and found that we learned a lot from that. A few of us overachievers wanted to continue working on small projects after graduation so this website was born. 
</p>
<p>
We are planning to do more than just work on projects so the goals for each one are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open source and well documented</li>
	<li>Written Java, Javascript, Python, Golang, C++, and C#</li>
	<li>Use visuals as much as posable</li>
	<li>Interesting and fun</li>
</ul>
