While in school we were required to work on a verity projects in ether c or java and found that we learned a lot from that. A few of us overachievers wanted to continue working on small projects after graduation so this website was born. 
We are planning to do more than just work on projects so the goals for each one are:
<ul>
	<li>Open source and well documented</li>
	<li>Written Java, Javascript, Python, Golang, C++, and C#</li>
	<li>Use visuals as much as posable</li>
	<li>Interesting and fun</li>
</ul>
